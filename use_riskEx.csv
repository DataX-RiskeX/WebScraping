          The stubbornly high cost of remittances      	
Stephen Cecchetti, Kim  Schoenholtz 27 March 2018 
	Despite recent technological advances, the costs for migrants to send money across borders to their families remain extremely expensive, with fees often surpassing 5%. This column explores the various factors shaping remittance prices and identifies two key avenues for cost reduction: consumer education and competition. In particular, expanding mobile technology is helping to displace banks and squeeze remittance costs.	a	A	""With the implementation of ‘know your client’ rules, anti-money laundering efforts, and so on, it has become increasingly difficult to have an efficient payments system. Many banks have retired from the business, for example, of handling remittances, which are a very important source of income for many emerging markets.”Guillermo Ortiz, 19 March 2015.1	When migrants send money across borders to their families, it promotes economic activity and supports incomes in some of the poorest countries of the world. Annual cross-border remittances are running about $600 billion, three quarters of which flow to low- and middle-income countries. To put that number into perspective, total development assistance worldwide is $150 billion.2 Indeed, for many countries, these transfers account for a significant fraction of people’s incomes. For example, in Guatemala, the Philippines, and Senegal, remittances exceed 10% of GDP.	Yet, despite the remarkable technological advances of recent decades, remittances remain extremely expensive. The virtues of domestic payments systems like Zelle, an inexpensive, bank-run means for person-to-person transfers up to several thousand dollars, are very clear (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2017b). The marginal cost of using Zelle is zero – that is, for customers of the bank, there is no charge.	Cross-border remittances are far from costless. On average, the charge for sending $200 – the benchmark used by authorities to evaluate cost – is $14. That is, the combination of fees (including charges from both the sender and recipient intermediaries) and the exchange rate margin typically eats up fully 7% of the amount sent. It is less expensive to send larger amounts, with the global average cost of sending $500 at just under 5% (World Bank 2017b). Even so, the aggregate cost of sending remittances in 2017 was about $30 billion, roughly equivalent to the total non-military foreign aid budget of the US!	In this column, we discuss remittances, why their costs remain high, and what might be done to lower them.	We start with a quick look at some data. Figure 1 below shows that the inflation-adjusted volume of remittances exploded over the past two decades. Today, these flows are triple what they were in 2000 and five times what they were in 1990. Furthermore, the economic importance of inward remittances has increased for low- and middle-income countries, rising from an average of 1.2% of GDP in 1990 to 1.6% of GDP today.	Figure 1 Aggregate volume of remittances, 1970-2017 (billions of 2017 US$)		Note: Inflation-adjusted sum of country-specific remittance flows. Source: World Bank.	You might think that this massive increase in volume either reflects, or promotes, cost-reducing advances in remittance technology. But, as the next figure shows, costs have trended lower only gradually, and with considerable differences across types of transfer agents and across sender countries. The red line is the simple, unweighted average for all providers – banks, money transfer operators (MTOs, including fintech companies) and post offices – of sending $200 from the full World Bank sample of 48 sending countries. Over the past decade, this global average has fallen from 9.8% to 7.1%. However, in the case of MTOs (the dashed, black line), like Western Union, the cost has stagnated in recent years. After falling by 2.5 percentage points before 2014, the average charge remains around 8%. And, in the US (the blue line), the cost has declined only very modestly, falling from just over 7% in 2009 to roughly 6%, where it has stayed for three years.	Importantly, remittances are a very profitable business for large operators. Western Union, for example, completed 268 million customer-to-customer transfers in 2016, with a value of $80 billion. Total revenue for the year exceeded $5 billion, with net profits surpassing $250 million.3	Figure 2 Average cost of sending $200 across a border, 2008-17 (% of total)		Note: The red and black lines show the evolution of the average cost of sending funds from any one of 48 sending countries to any of 105 receiving countries in the sample. The data include a total of 365 pairs (or corridors). The blue line shows the cost of sending from the US. Source: World Bank.	Drilling down to the corridor level (that is, to specific country pairs), remittance costs vary considerably, but still strike us as high in most instances. Take the benchmark case of sending $200 or the equivalent. The average cost of a transfer from the US to Mexico is $8.91; from Germany to Turkey, it is $12.83; and from South Africa to Botswana, the average is a whopping $36.60.	Even within a specific corridor, the cost varies substantially. For example, someone wishing to send $200 from Italy to Morocco would pay anywhere from $1.93, if they were able to use the internet service provided by Transferwise, to $14 if they went to Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a commercial bank. Using a Western Union agent for that same transfer would cost $10.17. While the speed of the transfer varies somewhat, the vast majority of services provide funds the next day or sooner.4	As mentioned, the aggregate global cost of these transfers is now roughly $30 billion per year. While the direct cost is borne by the migrant senders and their family recipients, there is a sense in which the burden also falls on poor countries as a whole. The reason is that remittances enhance growth in poor countries by providing alternative means for financing investment where transactions costs are high (Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz 2009). That is, we can think of policies that make remittances easier and cheaper as a means of boosting capital formation and productivity in receiving countries.	Against this background, in July 2009 the leaders of the largest advanced economies (G8) pledged to reduce the cost of remittances to 5% – a commitment endorsed by the G20 in 2011 and again in 2014, and included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 (G8 2009, G20 2011, United Nations 2015). After eight years, the global average is roughly half-way there. What can be done to lower remittance costs further?	There are two major mechanisms for reducing costs: education and competition. On the first, what if customers became sufficiently well informed that they only use the cheapest available services?  To answer this question, the World Bank has computed what they call the Smart Remitter Target (SmaRT). This competitive benchmark is the average of the three lowest-cost remittance service providers in each corridor. At the end of 2017, the global SmaRT average was 5.17%. This means that a process of education alone might be sufficient to reduce the average cost by as much as 2 percentage points.5	Turning to competition, Beck and Martínez Pería (2009) conclude that corridors with more migrants and more competition exhibit lower costs. Importantly, over one-half of all remittances are paid to persons in just ten countries (see below). However, where banks’ share in the business is high, costs are high as well. In fact, in the December 2017 issue of Remittance Prices Worldwide, the World Bank reports that remittance costs vary substantially by the instrument used, with transfers using cash and bank accounts costing 7%, much more than the 4.2% average cost of using mobile money (World bank 2017a). It appears that expanding mobile technology (and displacing banks) will help squeeze remittance costs.	Figure 3 Top 10 countries for inward remittances, 2017 (billions of $)		Source: World Bank.	But, as Guillermo Ortiz suggests in the quote at the top of this column, a key challenge looms. Most forms of cross-border funds transfer require the cooperation of a bank at some point in the process. An MTO, for example, needs accounts at banks on both ends of the transfer corridor. However, in response to stronger anti-money-laundering standards, banks have been terminating or restricting their relationships with MTOs (KNOMAD 2017).	From the perspective of a bank, mobile payments create similar risks. As is the case for virtual currencies like Bitcoin, mobile payments systems can be used to conceal nefarious activities (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2017a). Meeting the ‘know your customer’ standards that banks demand (and governments expect) is expensive. As a result, these factors may continue to throttle the speed with which cost-competitive technology firms make inroads into the remittance business.	That said, the goal of reducing the cost of small remittances to 5% is clearly within reach. And, efforts to streamline the know your customer and anti-money laundering processes (including through the use of legal entity identifiers) could get us there (and beyond) faster.6	Editors’ note: An earlier version of this column appeared on www.moneyandbanking.com.

1,Reuters,"Sign up now to get free exclusive access to reports, research and invitation only events.	Following Google and Facebook as online crackdown widens	Twitter Inc will start banning cryptocurrency advertising from Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in a clampdown that seeks to avoid giving publicity to potential fraud or large investor losses.	The prohibition will cover advertising of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – crowdfunding used to raise cash by creating new coins – as well as token sales, the San Francisco-based firm told Reuters on Monday.	The new policy, which will be rolled out over the next 30 days, will also ban ads by cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency wallet services, unless they are public companies listed on certain major stock markets.	For Japan, these will be limited to crypto exchanges regulated by its national financial regulator, Twitter said.	The firm had said this month it was taking measures to prevent crypto-related accounts from ""engaging with others in a deceptive manner"", but faced calls to go further after bans from Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.	Facebook has restricted crypto-related adverts, while Google announced a ban that comes into force in June.	The price of bitcoin, already 4 percent in the red on Monday, fell further after the Twitter announcement. It traded at $7,920 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange at 1740 GMT, down more than six per cent on the day.	Regulators' warnings	Regulators have stepped up warnings that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are highly speculative and that some could be fraudulent, and that investors should be prepared to lose everything.	But last week the G20 group of rich nations failed to reach a consensus on how to supervise them.	Adverts for virtual coins or ways to trade them have appeared everywhere from London's transport network to Japanese television as demand for them has soared.	""With the increasing number of ICOs coming to market, it is an impossible task for anyone, much less platforms likeTwitter or Facebook, to keep on top of which ICOs and cryptocurrencies are genuine versus frauds,"" said Zennon Kapron, director of the financial consultancy Kapronasia.	""Although certainly ICO advertising must have been a significant source of revenue for Twitter, the repercussions of fraudulent activities just weren't worth the risk.""	Bitcoin has lost more than half its value from a December peak of almost $20,000 as fears of a regulatory clampdown spooked investors. News of the Facebook and Google bans also knocked the price.	Ethereum and Ripple's XRP, the second- and third-biggest digital currencies by market capitalisation, have tumbled this year too.	While critics call cryptocurrencies a Ponzi scheme that will end in tears for most investors, supporters say the coins are backed by powerful new technology that can replace traditional fiat currencies and upend the existing banking system.

Find out how retail foreign exchange traders are looking at the New Zealand Dollar right now on the DailyFX Sentiment Page
	
The New Zealand Dollar didn’t get much of a lift from news of a surprise trade surplus in its homeland Monday, possibly because its central bank announced a change to its mandate which could keep interest rates lower for longer.
	
February’s overall surplus came in at NZ$217 million (US$153 million), against expectations of a NZ$ 100 million trade deficit. Within that both imports and exports rose by less than expected however, with the import miss perhaps likely to raise some questions about the underlying strength of the New Zealand economy despite some positive indications elsewhere.
	
Still, these latest figures do represent a bounce back from January’s deep deficit and it is perhaps surprising that the New Zealand Dollar failed to gain more strongly on them.
	
One reason might emanate from the direction of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Monday is the day when new Governor Adrian Orr takes over as Governor. His appointment was announced in December. However, the RBNZ also said on Monday that it had accepted a new dual monetary policy mandate.
	
Whereas before price stability was the RBNZ’s primary goal, it will now have to officially consider maximum, sustainable employment as a policy outcome too. This possibility was well known to the markets as New Zealand’s new government had made no secret of its intention to change the mandate since its election last year.
	
The most likely outcome of the change is probably that the RBNZ will now err on the side of keeping rates lower than it might have done in the days when it had a single policy target. With interest rates already at record lows, and inflation torpid, the mandate’s introduction may see the kiwi struggle, although markets have had some time to get used to it.
	
Indeed, this prospect is probably part of the reason behind NZD/USD’s gradual 2018 decline on its daily chart, which remains the dominant feature of trading.
	
At present the pair remains in the middle of the band formed by that downtrend channel, and is currently finding support at the highs of early January.

	The majority of ICOs are scams, but it's still a booming business, said CoinList CEO and Co-Founder Andy Bromberg. 	""The hit rate is very low in this industry,"" Bromberg told CNBC, regarding ICOs, or initial coin offerings, a crowdfunding way to raise funds for cryptocurrency ventures.	""CoinList has publicly had on our site only three ICOs out of more than 900 in-bound applications,"" he said on ""Fast Money"" Monday. His company, CoinList, is an online platform that guides token creators through the IPO process while helping investors determine which IPOs are legitimate. 	ICOs, a still-unregulated means of raising money in its ""modern form,"" Bromberg said, have been around for less than a year and thus are an attractive way for start-ups to raise capital while bypassing regulations. As the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin took off in 2017, ICOs became increasingly popular.	But even as major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have plunged, ICOs continue to gain speed. Already, ICOs have raised about $3 billion in funds this year — and the first quarter isn't even over yet. That's almost half of what ICOs raised last year. Still, Bromberg said, roughly half of all ICOs in 2017 failed. 	""They're incredibly risky early stage investments,""  said Bromberg, whose company manages nearly a billion dollars in crypto investments.  	Meanwhile, bitcoin and other cryptos are falling fast. Bitcoin, the largest digital coin by market cap, fell below $8,000 again, down 40 percent this year. Ethereum is down 33 percent year to date and Ripple is down 70 percent. 	Scrutiny from regulators, such as the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, over ICOs is increasing, something Bromberg called ""reasonable."" He also said it was wise for internet companies, such as Google and Twitter, to ban cryptocurrency ads on their platforms. 	""Evaluating these sales is really hard,"" he said. ""It requires a great deal of expertise. That's expertise that very few people have because the ICO industry is so new.""	While Bromberg said, ""regulation is coming,"" for ICOs, he also said there are things investors can do now to determine if an ICO is worth putting their money into. This includes evaluating the integrity of the company, the technical team and what products the company has built in the past.  	""At the beginning, you have to do the same team evaluation for any startup or any company you're investing in,"" he said. ""And that's really what helps you determine if the sale will help you finance a company that builds something meaningful, or if they're just raising money for the sake of raising money and going to run away with it.""","One expert said the majority of initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are scams — but it's still a booming business.",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/26/how-to-evaluate-risky-initial-coin-offerings-and-avoid-scams.html,2018-03-26 23:18:00+00:00,How to evaluate risky initial coin offerings and avoid scams
7,"Amanda Lee, Josh Ye, Amanda Lee, Josh Ye","	Blockchain	‘Where there’s demand, there will be supply … If there are gains to be made, then people will take risks,’ says vice-president of the Hong Kong Blockchain Society, of the enduring appeal of cryptocurrency offerings 	Comments:  		Initial coin offerings (ICOs) may well have been banned in China since September last year – but the opportunity of getting involved in these virtual fund-raisings, using “cryptocurrencies”, has far from disappeared altogether.	ICOs are a form of crowdsourced by which companies exchange their newly created online currencies, called “tokens”, for hard currency. 	Before the ban, ICOs were marketed across China using online platforms. But all those sites were closed nationally by The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, with operators ordered to return money to investors. 	The PBOC has since claimed in a report that a staggering 90 per cent of the ICOs launched in the country were fraudulent. 	Its biggest fear was social unrest arising from an ICO proving to be nothing more than a fraudulent way of raising cash from unsuspecting investors.	Bitcoin latest: prices, policies and politics	China’s monetary authorities were also acutely aware of virtual currencies and coin offers being used by corrupt officials to transfer money out of the country. 	The result was a blanket ban on online virtual currency exchanges offering trading services for domestic investors on transactions denominated in yuan.	But even with that ban in place, online agencies are still advising customers on how to get involved in ICOs, and funnelling interested parties in their direction, via overseas websites.	Instead of offerings marketed directly online, ICOs are often promoted on Tencent Holdings’ social messaging service WeChat through such agents or middlemen, who are charging hefty fees for the privilege.		One agent called An Hui Tian Ce Blockchain charges up to 10 per cent commission for each offering and according to a list its customers have been sent on WeChat, there are currently eight ICOs available. These include names such as RightMesh, Dfinity, and Wireline, the last of which is presented on a dedicated Chinese-language site. Where they are eventually listing and their values remain unknown.	Canada-based RightMesh claims to be the first platform to offer investments in mobile mesh networks – communications networks using radio nodes – using blockchain technology. 	Dfinity is building a new kind of public decentralised cloud computing resource, while Wireline is planning to operate a micro-services exchange for developers. 	“RightMesh is not seeking investment in China and has no affiliation with Tian Ce,” a spokesperson representing the Canadian company, said in an emailed statement.		An Hui Tian Ce Blockchain’s customer service representative told South China Morning Post that the charge is required upfront, depending on the amount being bought, and must be paid in ethereum – a token popular among ICO organisers that is similar to bitcoin, arguably the world’s best-known virtual currency.	There is no official data on how many are operating or how much has been raised on WeChat or other social media platforms in China. 	Beijing bans bitcoin, but when did it all go wrong for cryptocurrencies in China?	But commentators suggested the original risks which prompted the Chinese authorities to outlaw them in the first place still exist – effectively, that these agents could run away after the fees are paid, as could their investments.	CNBC reported last year, for instance, that a start-up ICO for a company called Confido deleted its site and social media accounts soon after raising US$375,000. 	While direct sales online are not permitted, Dragonsocial – a Hong Kong-based marketing agency which helps foreign ICO companies reach Chinese investors – has also been actively building what it calls “cryptocurrency communities” on WeChat.		“Lots of companies launched ICOs last year, when there were a limited number of investors. 	“We thought it was high time to provide them with a service,” said Cao Ming Xiu, Dragonsocial’s operations officer in mainland China.	China wants to be a front runner in blockchain technology even if the ban on bitcoin remains	“There were many cases in China where people posted adverts with big WeChat groups. But that goes against Chinese regulations, and we don’t do that.	“Rather, what we do is community-building. We don’t promote our clients and their ICOs in groups, instead we discuss them.”	Cao said more than 20,000 such WeChat groups exist nationwide, focused on discussion rather actual ICO execution.	“Some groups have hundreds of people involved. A small percentage of them are our employees, and they lead conversations,” said Raymond Lam, Dragonsocial’s head of growth. “It is through that, we help members discuss certain new projects.”	The companies Dragonsocial represents, Lam said, are often involved in financial technology and logistics ICOs.	“Through discussion within these groups, there are now [more] people in the mainland capable and aware of reaching overseas websites or official ICO outlets, that allow them to invest in cryptocurrencies,” Cao said.	“The mainland has banned ICOs. So cryptocurrency investors now have to access overseas trading platforms to exchange theirs [cryptos] for US dollars or Hong Kong dollars.”	Why has China declared war on bitcoin and digital currencies?	Emil Chan, vice-president at the Hong Kong Blockchain Society, believes it is hard to effectively regulate the dealers, without an official licensing mechanism in place. 	But with the number of tokens issued last year globally rising a hundred-fold, he said speculators are sure to continue jumping on the bandwagon, regardless of the fears that undoubtedly still exist.	According to ICO tracking firm Token Data, of the 902 token sales launched last year, 46 per cent failed to materialise.	“But where there’s demand, there will be supply,” said Chan. “If there are gains to be made, then people will take risks.” 	He said a more meaningful way of tackling illegal ICO sales is to issue licences, which is already happening in Japan. Cryptocurrency exchanges there, require a payment institution licence to operate.  	“There is actually no way to ban all unregulated dealers, he said. [If you ban one], they’ll just set up another,” Chan said. 	 	You are signed up.

While Bottoms told Channel 2 Action News Monday morning that the city is making more progress each day, the situation is not yet resolved.	“This is much bigger than a ransomware attack.

9,Thomas Delahunty,"-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis	Cyber-criminals attempting to con people out of their Bitcoin are getting more and more creative — but we’ve never seen anything like this: a would-be victim has convinced a Bitcoin scammer to paint his face like a raccoon and rifle through his neighbor’s trash can. The pictures of their interaction and resulting photos have since gone viral as the prankster somehow got the Egyptian conman to comply with strange demands.	As reported by the Irish Mirror, Belfast man Neil Murphy, 34, was sent a friend request on Facebook with messages inquiring about Bitcoin. Murphy’s suspicions were immediately aroused that it could be a scam, but he decided to have some fun.  	Instead of telling Yousef, who said he was from Egypt, to leave him alone, he agreed to send him 0.15 Bitcoin if Yousef dressed up as a raccoon and foraged through his neighbor’s trash cans. When Yousef asked for $100 worth of Bitcoin in a bid to secure the deal, Murphy said: 	“I cannot trust you. I have been scammed before. “Last time I sent somebody the Bitcoin and he sent me a picture of him dressed as a badger instead of a racoon and he didn’t even scavenge in a bin.”	Yosef, somehow obliged, saying: “I’ll wear the raccoons and send you a picture.”	“I also love raccoons very much and we have a farm that has a lot of them.” 	He then told Murphy that it would take him at least two days to source the outfit and take the pictures. Murphy replied: “Ok maybe you don’t even need to buy a costume you could just put some white stripes on your face and you will look like an natural raccoon.”	For the final set of photos, Murphy made some more demands. He asked Yousef to wear a black and white striped top — for a more realistic raccoon look — and said he wanted there to be more trash in the photo and for it to be taken at night.	The desperate scammer complied and sent more photos of himself in the striped top, this time scavenging in a huge over-turned trash can. Murphy, then, decided to end things and told Yousef he would not be receiving any money. In response the scammer blocked him. 	The full conversation can be found here.	fake story got to do better than this/	Yeah, not buying it either.	send ME .15 BTC and I’ll let you watch me paint my toes live via webcam.

10,Scott Scanlon,"Nongaming venues inside Las Vegas casinos such as high-end clubs, restaurants and retail outlets are moving quicker to capture a young, generally wealthy, niche clientele. Strip casinos might never accept cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin on the gaming floor because of the state’s industry regulations.	 But nongaming venues inside those establishments, such as high-end clubs, restaurants and retail outlets, are working to capture the young, generally wealthy niche clients who use cryptocurrencies. The effort is being supported by people traveling to Las Vegas for technology and finance conferences that touch on cryptocurrencies, such as CES and Money20/20.	 And at least seven conferences in Las Vegas this year are dedicated to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the backbone of the new digital money. The Elena Bulatova Gallery in The Shops at Crystals on the Strip began accepting cryptocurrencies this year after receiving about 20 inquires, said gallery manager Vince Notardonato.	 Bulatova, who has four galleries in the western United States, made her first sale with bitcoin at her Palm Springs location in mid-March. Bulatova, who was pursing a doctorate in economics before launching her art career, said she has a personal interest in cryptocurrencies.	 Her experience has shown her that acceptance in Las Vegas venues will be a function not only of customer demand but also of management understanding and enthusiasm. ”I thought accepting cryptocurrencies would increase the buying pool of people. If someone bought cryptocurrencies a few years ago, they can afford to buy a lot of things now, like artwork,” she said.

Bitcoin dropped below US$8,000 ($10,964) to US$7,863, according to Coindesk.	 Twitter Inc. confirmed Monday that it's banning advertisements for initial coin offerings and token sales on its social-media platform. The decision comes after Facebook Inc. banned cryptocurrency ads in January and Alphabet Inc.'s Google said it would ban such ads starting in June, as part of a broader effort to crack down on deceptive and misleading advertising on their platforms.	 After reaching a record high of almost US$20,000 in December, Bitcoin has slumped about 60 per cent as investors reconsider the prospects of the digital currency and regulators around the world increase scrutiny.	 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sent a number of subpoenas earlier this month to ICO teams it suspects are breaking securities regulations, and it has warned since July that some of the offerings may be breaking securities regulations.

13,Reuters Editorial,"2 Min Read	(Reuters) - Atlanta is still struggling with its ability to collect online payments of bills and fees, officials said on Monday, four days after a ransomware attack snarled the computer system of Georgia’s capital city. 	Hackers caused outages of services offered through the city’s website and broader computer system while demanding a ransom of $51,000 paid in bitcoin to unlock the system.  	“This is much bigger than a ransomware attack, this really is an attack on our government,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told a news conference. “We are dealing with a (cyber) hostage situation.” 	She did not say whether Atlanta would pay the ransom. Atlanta officials said they have determined the hackers’ identity but declined to elaborate. City representatives were not immediately available for further comment. 	Bottoms said only that the hackers entered the city’s digital system remotely as opposed having had internal access. 	Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computers or computer networks and then freezes them, with the attackers demanding a ransom in order to restore services. The initial assault often comes via a phishing link that someone within the network opens on their email.  	As the disruption in Atlanta persists, the city is losing out financially, Bottoms told an earlier news conference on Friday.

I have compared this model to others and to pictures of the original prop and this seems to be the most accurate by far.
Any change to create a version of the handle with a battery compartment and some kind of path for optical fiber/wiring? (For That red led when the pistol is engaged).
Many thanks in advance.

17,Cointelegraph By Rakesh Upadhyay,"Cointelegraph	Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies.	Price Analysis	The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.	The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.	During a bear market, fear grips the investors, resulting in a long liquidation. While some believe that the bubble in Bitcoin has burst, others believe that the current fall is only a correction, which will lead to higher prices later in the year.	Founder and chairman of investment firm LDJ Capital, David Drake believes that Bitcoin will rally to $30,000 by the year-end. That is a whopping 262 percent return from the current levels.	Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, believes that Bitcoin can replace the fiat currencies within a decade.	A few positive voices in a sea of gloom is a welcome change. Let’s see if the short-term picture is improving or not.	Though Bitcoin broke out of the descending channel on March 20, it could not cross above the 20-day EMA. Currently, prices are again threatening to dip back into the channel, which is a bearish development. Our long positions initiated at $8,800 are trading under a loss. As the setup looks negative, we suggest booking a loss on 50 percent of the open positions and holding the rest with the stops at $7,600.		The next support on the downside is the March 18 lows of $7,715, below which, a retest of the February 06 lows of $6,075.04 is possible.	Our bearish view on the BTC/USD pair will be invalidated if prices breakout and sustain above the 50-day SMA.	Ethereum is in a strong downtrend. It continues to trade inside the channel and below both the moving averages, which are falling sharply. The recovery attempt by the bulls failed at the $590 levels.  		The final critical support on the downside is the March 18 lows of $452.32. Below this level, the ETH/USD pair can fall to $385.	The RSI is deeply oversold, which shows that the selling has been overdone. We anticipate another pullback attempt within the next few days. The first sign of strength will be when the bulls sustain above $600. Until then, the bears will continue to sell on rallies.	Bitcoin Cash has broken below the $1,000 levels after holding it for three days. The next support on the downside is the March 18 lows $884.7951.		If the BCH/USD pair breaks below this, it will retest the February 06 lows of $778.2021. Bears have the upper hand as they have not allowed the price to climb above the 20-day EMA since February 21.	We should turn positive only after the cryptocurrency breaks out of the 50-day SMA.       	Our anticipation of a range bound trading action on Ripple is proving to be wrong. Prices are falling sharply towards the lower end of the range at $0.56270. Our suggested long position at $0.71, on March 19 is deeply in the red. Our stop loss is at $0.52, just below the March 18 lows.		If the XRP/USD pair breaks below $0.5375, a fall to $0.22 is possible, because there is no support in between.	The cryptocurrency will become positive only above $0.72.	Stellar did not close above our buy trigger of $0.25, as recommended in the previous analysis. Therefore, we don’t have any position in it.		The XLM/USD pair is gradually falling towards the $0.2 levels, which is a critical support. If this support breaks, the cryptocurrency can slide to the support line of the descending channel at $0.1 levels.	We’d better wait for prices to turn up before suggesting any long positions in it.	Our long position in Litecoin recommended at $165 is under loss. Traders who have initiated long positions should keep the stop loss at $142.		The LTC/USD pair has again fallen below the downtrend line, which is a bearish sign. A critical support is the March 18 lows of $144.544. If this level breaks, the support line of the symmetrical triangle can provide support at $127, below which a retest of the February 02 lows of $107.102 will be on the cards.	The virtual currency will turn bullish only after it breaks out of the $200 levels.	Though Cardano broke out of the downtrend line on March 21, it could not break out of the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance at 0.00002460. Our buy levels of 0.000025 have not triggered and stand canceled.		The ADA/BTC pair will spend a few days in the range of 0.00001690 and 0.00002460. A breakdown below the supports will prove to be bearish while a breakout will carry prices higher. Therefore, we need to wait for a breakout and close above the overhead resistance before initiating any trade.	NEO has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $65.		After the initial bounce from the lows of $49.04 on March 18, we had expected the bulls to strongly defend the $65 levels during the pullback. However, after failing to rise above $70 for the past three days, prices have now broken down of the support levels.	Next, if $49.04 level breaks, the NEO/USD pair can slide to $31.15 levels. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls quickly reverse and sustain prices above $65.   	We wanted to buy EOS once it broke out of the descending channel but that did not happen. After staying above the 20-day EMA for the past five days, prices have slipped this week.		The EOS/USD pair has some support at the $5.84 mark. Below that, it can slide to $5 levels.	On the upside, even if the bulls manage to push prices above the 20-day EMA, they will again face a stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA.	The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

          The stubbornly high cost of remittances      	
Stephen Cecchetti, Kim  Schoenholtz 27 March 2018 
	Despite recent technological advances, the costs for migrants to send money across borders to their families remain extremely expensive, with fees often surpassing 5%. This column explores the various factors shaping remittance prices and identifies two key avenues for cost reduction: consumer education and competition. In particular, expanding mobile technology is helping to displace banks and squeeze remittance costs.	a	A	""With the implementation of ‘know your client’ rules, anti-money laundering efforts, and so on, it has become increasingly difficult to have an efficient payments system. Many banks have retired from the business, for example, of handling remittances, which are a very important source of income for many emerging markets.”Guillermo Ortiz, 19 March 2015.1	When migrants send money across borders to their families, it promotes economic activity and supports incomes in some of the poorest countries of the world. Annual cross-border remittances are running about $600 billion, three quarters of which flow to low- and middle-income countries. To put that number into perspective, total development assistance worldwide is $150 billion.2 Indeed, for many countries, these transfers account for a significant fraction of people’s incomes. For example, in Guatemala, the Philippines, and Senegal, remittances exceed 10% of GDP.	Yet, despite the remarkable technological advances of recent decades, remittances remain extremely expensive. The virtues of domestic payments systems like Zelle, an inexpensive, bank-run means for person-to-person transfers up to several thousand dollars, are very clear (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2017b). The marginal cost of using Zelle is zero – that is, for customers of the bank, there is no charge.	Cross-border remittances are far from costless. On average, the charge for sending $200 – the benchmark used by authorities to evaluate cost – is $14. That is, the combination of fees (including charges from both the sender and recipient intermediaries) and the exchange rate margin typically eats up fully 7% of the amount sent. It is less expensive to send larger amounts, with the global average cost of sending $500 at just under 5% (World Bank 2017b). Even so, the aggregate cost of sending remittances in 2017 was about $30 billion, roughly equivalent to the total non-military foreign aid budget of the US!	In this column, we discuss remittances, why their costs remain high, and what might be done to lower them.	We start with a quick look at some data. Figure 1 below shows that the inflation-adjusted volume of remittances exploded over the past two decades. Today, these flows are triple what they were in 2000 and five times what they were in 1990. Furthermore, the economic importance of inward remittances has increased for low- and middle-income countries, rising from an average of 1.2% of GDP in 1990 to 1.6% of GDP today.	Figure 1 Aggregate volume of remittances, 1970-2017 (billions of 2017 US$)		Note: Inflation-adjusted sum of country-specific remittance flows. Source: World Bank.	You might think that this massive increase in volume either reflects, or promotes, cost-reducing advances in remittance technology. But, as the next figure shows, costs have trended lower only gradually, and with considerable differences across types of transfer agents and across sender countries. The red line is the simple, unweighted average for all providers – banks, money transfer operators (MTOs, including fintech companies) and post offices – of sending $200 from the full World Bank sample of 48 sending countries. Over the past decade, this global average has fallen from 9.8% to 7.1%. However, in the case of MTOs (the dashed, black line), like Western Union, the cost has stagnated in recent years. After falling by 2.5 percentage points before 2014, the average charge remains around 8%. And, in the US (the blue line), the cost has declined only very modestly, falling from just over 7% in 2009 to roughly 6%, where it has stayed for three years.	Importantly, remittances are a very profitable business for large operators. Western Union, for example, completed 268 million customer-to-customer transfers in 2016, with a value of $80 billion. Total revenue for the year exceeded $5 billion, with net profits surpassing $250 million.3	Figure 2 Average cost of sending $200 across a border, 2008-17 (% of total)		Note: The red and black lines show the evolution of the average cost of sending funds from any one of 48 sending countries to any of 105 receiving countries in the sample. The data include a total of 365 pairs (or corridors). The blue line shows the cost of sending from the US. Source: World Bank.	Drilling down to the corridor level (that is, to specific country pairs), remittance costs vary considerably, but still strike us as high in most instances. Take the benchmark case of sending $200 or the equivalent. The average cost of a transfer from the US to Mexico is $8.91; from Germany to Turkey, it is $12.83; and from South Africa to Botswana, the average is a whopping $36.60.	Even within a specific corridor, the cost varies substantially. For example, someone wishing to send $200 from Italy to Morocco would pay anywhere from $1.93, if they were able to use the internet service provided by Transferwise, to $14 if they went to Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a commercial bank. Using a Western Union agent for that same transfer would cost $10.17. While the speed of the transfer varies somewhat, the vast majority of services provide funds the next day or sooner.4	As mentioned, the aggregate global cost of these transfers is now roughly $30 billion per year. While the direct cost is borne by the migrant senders and their family recipients, there is a sense in which the burden also falls on poor countries as a whole. The reason is that remittances enhance growth in poor countries by providing alternative means for financing investment where transactions costs are high (Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz 2009). That is, we can think of policies that make remittances easier and cheaper as a means of boosting capital formation and productivity in receiving countries.	Against this background, in July 2009 the leaders of the largest advanced economies (G8) pledged to reduce the cost of remittances to 5% – a commitment endorsed by the G20 in 2011 and again in 2014, and included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 (G8 2009, G20 2011, United Nations 2015). After eight years, the global average is roughly half-way there. What can be done to lower remittance costs further?	There are two major mechanisms for reducing costs: education and competition. On the first, what if customers became sufficiently well informed that they only use the cheapest available services?  To answer this question, the World Bank has computed what they call the Smart Remitter Target (SmaRT). This competitive benchmark is the average of the three lowest-cost remittance service providers in each corridor. At the end of 2017, the global SmaRT average was 5.17%. This means that a process of education alone might be sufficient to reduce the average cost by as much as 2 percentage points.5	Turning to competition, Beck and Martínez Pería (2009) conclude that corridors with more migrants and more competition exhibit lower costs. Importantly, over one-half of all remittances are paid to persons in just ten countries (see below). However, where banks’ share in the business is high, costs are high as well. In fact, in the December 2017 issue of Remittance Prices Worldwide, the World Bank reports that remittance costs vary substantially by the instrument used, with transfers using cash and bank accounts costing 7%, much more than the 4.2% average cost of using mobile money (World bank 2017a). It appears that expanding mobile technology (and displacing banks) will help squeeze remittance costs.	Figure 3 Top 10 countries for inward remittances, 2017 (billions of $)		Source: World Bank.	But, as Guillermo Ortiz suggests in the quote at the top of this column, a key challenge looms. Most forms of cross-border funds transfer require the cooperation of a bank at some point in the process. An MTO, for example, needs accounts at banks on both ends of the transfer corridor. However, in response to stronger anti-money-laundering standards, banks have been terminating or restricting their relationships with MTOs (KNOMAD 2017).	From the perspective of a bank, mobile payments create similar risks. As is the case for virtual currencies like Bitcoin, mobile payments systems can be used to conceal nefarious activities (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2017a). Meeting the ‘know your customer’ standards that banks demand (and governments expect) is expensive. As a result, these factors may continue to throttle the speed with which cost-competitive technology firms make inroads into the remittance business.	That said, the goal of reducing the cost of small remittances to 5% is clearly within reach. And, efforts to streamline the know your customer and anti-money laundering processes (including through the use of legal entity identifiers) could get us there (and beyond) faster.6	Editors’ note: An earlier version of this column appeared on www.moneyandbanking.com.

21,Reuters,"Sign up now to get free exclusive access to reports, research and invitation only events.	Following Google and Facebook as online crackdown widens	Twitter Inc will start banning cryptocurrency advertising from Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in a clampdown that seeks to avoid giving publicity to potential fraud or large investor losses.	The prohibition will cover advertising of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – crowdfunding used to raise cash by creating new coins – as well as token sales, the San Francisco-based firm told Reuters on Monday.	The new policy, which will be rolled out over the next 30 days, will also ban ads by cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency wallet services, unless they are public companies listed on certain major stock markets.	For Japan, these will be limited to crypto exchanges regulated by its national financial regulator, Twitter said.	The firm had said this month it was taking measures to prevent crypto-related accounts from ""engaging with others in a deceptive manner"", but faced calls to go further after bans from Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.	Facebook has restricted crypto-related adverts, while Google announced a ban that comes into force in June.	The price of bitcoin, already 4 percent in the red on Monday, fell further after the Twitter announcement. It traded at $7,920 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange at 1740 GMT, down more than six per cent on the day.	Regulators' warnings	Regulators have stepped up warnings that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are highly speculative and that some could be fraudulent, and that investors should be prepared to lose everything.	But last week the G20 group of rich nations failed to reach a consensus on how to supervise them.	Adverts for virtual coins or ways to trade them have appeared everywhere from London's transport network to Japanese television as demand for them has soared.	""With the increasing number of ICOs coming to market, it is an impossible task for anyone, much less platforms likeTwitter or Facebook, to keep on top of which ICOs and cryptocurrencies are genuine versus frauds,"" said Zennon Kapron, director of the financial consultancy Kapronasia.	""Although certainly ICO advertising must have been a significant source of revenue for Twitter, the repercussions of fraudulent activities just weren't worth the risk.""	Bitcoin has lost more than half its value from a December peak of almost $20,000 as fears of a regulatory clampdown spooked investors. News of the Facebook and Google bans also knocked the price.	Ethereum and Ripple's XRP, the second- and third-biggest digital currencies by market capitalisation, have tumbled this year too.	While critics call cryptocurrencies a Ponzi scheme that will end in tears for most investors, supporters say the coins are backed by powerful new technology that can replace traditional fiat currencies and upend the existing banking system.

Find out how retail foreign exchange traders are looking at the New Zealand Dollar right now on the DailyFX Sentiment Page
	
The New Zealand Dollar didn’t get much of a lift from news of a surprise trade surplus in its homeland Monday, possibly because its central bank announced a change to its mandate which could keep interest rates lower for longer.
	
February’s overall surplus came in at NZ$217 million (US$153 million), against expectations of a NZ$ 100 million trade deficit. Within that both imports and exports rose by less than expected however, with the import miss perhaps likely to raise some questions about the underlying strength of the New Zealand economy despite some positive indications elsewhere.
	
Still, these latest figures do represent a bounce back from January’s deep deficit and it is perhaps surprising that the New Zealand Dollar failed to gain more strongly on them.
	
One reason might emanate from the direction of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Monday is the day when new Governor Adrian Orr takes over as Governor. His appointment was announced in December. However, the RBNZ also said on Monday that it had accepted a new dual monetary policy mandate.
	
Whereas before price stability was the RBNZ’s primary goal, it will now have to officially consider maximum, sustainable employment as a policy outcome too. This possibility was well known to the markets as New Zealand’s new government had made no secret of its intention to change the mandate since its election last year.
	
The most likely outcome of the change is probably that the RBNZ will now err on the side of keeping rates lower than it might have done in the days when it had a single policy target. With interest rates already at record lows, and inflation torpid, the mandate’s introduction may see the kiwi struggle, although markets have had some time to get used to it.
	
Indeed, this prospect is probably part of the reason behind NZD/USD’s gradual 2018 decline on its daily chart, which remains the dominant feature of trading.
	
At present the pair remains in the middle of the band formed by that downtrend channel, and is currently finding support at the highs of early January.

	The majority of ICOs are scams, but it's still a booming business, said CoinList CEO and Co-Founder Andy Bromberg. 	""The hit rate is very low in this industry,"" Bromberg told CNBC, regarding ICOs, or initial coin offerings, a crowdfunding way to raise funds for cryptocurrency ventures.	""CoinList has publicly had on our site only three ICOs out of more than 900 in-bound applications,"" he said on ""Fast Money"" Monday. His company, CoinList, is an online platform that guides token creators through the IPO process while helping investors determine which IPOs are legitimate. 	ICOs, a still-unregulated means of raising money in its ""modern form,"" Bromberg said, have been around for less than a year and thus are an attractive way for start-ups to raise capital while bypassing regulations. As the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin took off in 2017, ICOs became increasingly popular.	But even as major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have plunged, ICOs continue to gain speed. Already, ICOs have raised about $3 billion in funds this year — and the first quarter isn't even over yet. That's almost half of what ICOs raised last year. Still, Bromberg said, roughly half of all ICOs in 2017 failed. 	""They're incredibly risky early stage investments,""  said Bromberg, whose company manages nearly a billion dollars in crypto investments.  	Meanwhile, bitcoin and other cryptos are falling fast. Bitcoin, the largest digital coin by market cap, fell below $8,000 again, down 40 percent this year. Ethereum is down 33 percent year to date and Ripple is down 70 percent. 	Scrutiny from regulators, such as the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, over ICOs is increasing, something Bromberg called ""reasonable."" He also said it was wise for internet companies, such as Google and Twitter, to ban cryptocurrency ads on their platforms. 	""Evaluating these sales is really hard,"" he said. ""It requires a great deal of expertise. That's expertise that very few people have because the ICO industry is so new.""	While Bromberg said, ""regulation is coming,"" for ICOs, he also said there are things investors can do now to determine if an ICO is worth putting their money into. This includes evaluating the integrity of the company, the technical team and what products the company has built in the past.  	""At the beginning, you have to do the same team evaluation for any startup or any company you're investing in,"" he said. ""And that's really what helps you determine if the sale will help you finance a company that builds something meaningful, or if they're just raising money for the sake of raising money and going to run away with it.""","One expert said the majority of initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are scams — but it's still a booming business.",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/26/how-to-evaluate-risky-initial-coin-offerings-and-avoid-scams.html,2018-03-26 23:18:00+00:00,How to evaluate risky initial coin offerings and avoid scams
27,"Amanda Lee, Josh Ye, Amanda Lee, Josh Ye","	Blockchain	‘Where there’s demand, there will be supply … If there are gains to be made, then people will take risks,’ says vice-president of the Hong Kong Blockchain Society, of the enduring appeal of cryptocurrency offerings 	Comments:  		Initial coin offerings (ICOs) may well have been banned in China since September last year – but the opportunity of getting involved in these virtual fund-raisings, using “cryptocurrencies”, has far from disappeared altogether.	ICOs are a form of crowdsourced by which companies exchange their newly created online currencies, called “tokens”, for hard currency. 	Before the ban, ICOs were marketed across China using online platforms. But all those sites were closed nationally by The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, with operators ordered to return money to investors. 	The PBOC has since claimed in a report that a staggering 90 per cent of the ICOs launched in the country were fraudulent. 	Its biggest fear was social unrest arising from an ICO proving to be nothing more than a fraudulent way of raising cash from unsuspecting investors.	Bitcoin latest: prices, policies and politics	China’s monetary authorities were also acutely aware of virtual currencies and coin offers being used by corrupt officials to transfer money out of the country. 	The result was a blanket ban on online virtual currency exchanges offering trading services for domestic investors on transactions denominated in yuan.	But even with that ban in place, online agencies are still advising customers on how to get involved in ICOs, and funnelling interested parties in their direction, via overseas websites.	Instead of offerings marketed directly online, ICOs are often promoted on Tencent Holdings’ social messaging service WeChat through such agents or middlemen, who are charging hefty fees for the privilege.		One agent called An Hui Tian Ce Blockchain charges up to 10 per cent commission for each offering and according to a list its customers have been sent on WeChat, there are currently eight ICOs available. These include names such as RightMesh, Dfinity, and Wireline, the last of which is presented on a dedicated Chinese-language site. Where they are eventually listing and their values remain unknown.	Canada-based RightMesh claims to be the first platform to offer investments in mobile mesh networks – communications networks using radio nodes – using blockchain technology. 	Dfinity is building a new kind of public decentralised cloud computing resource, while Wireline is planning to operate a micro-services exchange for developers. 	“RightMesh is not seeking investment in China and has no affiliation with Tian Ce,” a spokesperson representing the Canadian company, said in an emailed statement.		An Hui Tian Ce Blockchain’s customer service representative told South China Morning Post that the charge is required upfront, depending on the amount being bought, and must be paid in ethereum – a token popular among ICO organisers that is similar to bitcoin, arguably the world’s best-known virtual currency.	There is no official data on how many are operating or how much has been raised on WeChat or other social media platforms in China. 	Beijing bans bitcoin, but when did it all go wrong for cryptocurrencies in China?	But commentators suggested the original risks which prompted the Chinese authorities to outlaw them in the first place still exist – effectively, that these agents could run away after the fees are paid, as could their investments.	CNBC reported last year, for instance, that a start-up ICO for a company called Confido deleted its site and social media accounts soon after raising US$375,000. 	While direct sales online are not permitted, Dragonsocial – a Hong Kong-based marketing agency which helps foreign ICO companies reach Chinese investors – has also been actively building what it calls “cryptocurrency communities” on WeChat.		“Lots of companies launched ICOs last year, when there were a limited number of investors. 	“We thought it was high time to provide them with a service,” said Cao Ming Xiu, Dragonsocial’s operations officer in mainland China.	China wants to be a front runner in blockchain technology even if the ban on bitcoin remains	“There were many cases in China where people posted adverts with big WeChat groups. But that goes against Chinese regulations, and we don’t do that.	“Rather, what we do is community-building. We don’t promote our clients and their ICOs in groups, instead we discuss them.”	Cao said more than 20,000 such WeChat groups exist nationwide, focused on discussion rather actual ICO execution.	“Some groups have hundreds of people involved. A small percentage of them are our employees, and they lead conversations,” said Raymond Lam, Dragonsocial’s head of growth. “It is through that, we help members discuss certain new projects.”	The companies Dragonsocial represents, Lam said, are often involved in financial technology and logistics ICOs.	“Through discussion within these groups, there are now [more] people in the mainland capable and aware of reaching overseas websites or official ICO outlets, that allow them to invest in cryptocurrencies,” Cao said.	“The mainland has banned ICOs. So cryptocurrency investors now have to access overseas trading platforms to exchange theirs [cryptos] for US dollars or Hong Kong dollars.”	Why has China declared war on bitcoin and digital currencies?	Emil Chan, vice-president at the Hong Kong Blockchain Society, believes it is hard to effectively regulate the dealers, without an official licensing mechanism in place. 	But with the number of tokens issued last year globally rising a hundred-fold, he said speculators are sure to continue jumping on the bandwagon, regardless of the fears that undoubtedly still exist.	According to ICO tracking firm Token Data, of the 902 token sales launched last year, 46 per cent failed to materialise.	“But where there’s demand, there will be supply,” said Chan. “If there are gains to be made, then people will take risks.” 	He said a more meaningful way of tackling illegal ICO sales is to issue licences, which is already happening in Japan. Cryptocurrency exchanges there, require a payment institution licence to operate.  	“There is actually no way to ban all unregulated dealers, he said. [If you ban one], they’ll just set up another,” Chan said. 	 	You are signed up.

While Bottoms told Channel 2 Action News Monday morning that the city is making more progress each day, the situation is not yet resolved.	“This is much bigger than a ransomware attack. This really is an attack on our government, which means this is an attack on all of us and we just want to continue to be thoughtful, and will continue to be thoughtful to make sure that as a city that we are doing all that we need to do to make sure that we are secure going forward,” Bottoms said.	Many city departments still feel the impact of the ransomware attack, including at municipal court.

Watershed Management customers need to apply for new service in person, and customers cannot pay their bills online or in person for now.	The hack has also forced Atlanta police to write up officer reports by hand.	City council is working on a new workflow.	TRENDING STORIES:	While the mayor said there’s still no evidence any sensitive employee or resident data has been compromised, residents like Arnette Barber told us they're worried.	“That is pretty scary, and I do expect them to put somethings in place that this doesn’t happen again,"" Barber said.	The cyber attack happened early Thursday morning. Since then, Bottoms said teams have been working 24/7 to get city systems back online. She said the city has brought in what she calls “best in class” external partners for guidance.

We just have to make sure that we’re doing all that we can do and making the investments in the city to be as protected as possible,” Bottoms said.	So far, Bottoms has given no indication that the city will pay the six-bitcoin ransom, which equates to about $50,000.	“We are a resilient city, and we are a resilient government,” Bottoms said.	City officials tweeted Monday:	""There is no evidence to show that customer or employee data has been compromised.

29,Thomas Delahunty,"-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis	Cyber-criminals attempting to con people out of their Bitcoin are getting more and more creative — but we’ve never seen anything like this: a would-be victim has convinced a Bitcoin scammer to paint his face like a raccoon and rifle through his neighbor’s trash can. The pictures of their interaction and resulting photos have since gone viral as the prankster somehow got the Egyptian conman to comply with strange demands.	As reported by the Irish Mirror, Belfast man Neil Murphy, 34, was sent a friend request on Facebook with messages inquiring about Bitcoin. Murphy’s suspicions were immediately aroused that it could be a scam, but he decided to have some fun.  	Instead of telling Yousef, who said he was from Egypt, to leave him alone, he agreed to send him 0.15 Bitcoin if Yousef dressed up as a raccoon and foraged through his neighbor’s trash cans. When Yousef asked for $100 worth of Bitcoin in a bid to secure the deal, Murphy said: 	“I cannot trust you. I have been scammed before. “Last time I sent somebody the Bitcoin and he sent me a picture of him dressed as a badger instead of a racoon and he didn’t even scavenge in a bin.”	Yosef, somehow obliged, saying: “I’ll wear the raccoons and send you a picture.”	“I also love raccoons very much and we have a farm that has a lot of them.” 	He then told Murphy that it would take him at least two days to source the outfit and take the pictures. Murphy replied: “Ok maybe you don’t even need to buy a costume you could just put some white stripes on your face and you will look like an natural raccoon.”	For the final set of photos, Murphy made some more demands. He asked Yousef to wear a black and white striped top — for a more realistic raccoon look — and said he wanted there to be more trash in the photo and for it to be taken at night.	The desperate scammer complied and sent more photos of himself in the striped top, this time scavenging in a huge over-turned trash can. Murphy, then, decided to end things and told Yousef he would not be receiving any money. In response the scammer blocked him. 	The full conversation can be found here.	fake story got to do better than this/	Yeah, not buying it either.	send ME .15 BTC and I’ll let you watch me paint my toes live via webcam.

30,Scott Scanlon,"Nongaming venues inside Las Vegas casinos such as high-end clubs, restaurants and retail outlets are moving quicker to capture a young, generally wealthy, niche clientele. Strip casinos might never accept cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin on the gaming floor because of the state’s industry regulations.	 But nongaming venues inside those establishments, such as high-end clubs, restaurants and retail outlets, are working to capture the young, generally wealthy niche clients who use cryptocurrencies. The effort is being supported by people traveling to Las Vegas for technology and finance conferences that touch on cryptocurrencies, such as CES and Money20/20.	 And at least seven conferences in Las Vegas this year are dedicated to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the backbone of the new digital money. The Elena Bulatova Gallery in The Shops at Crystals on the Strip began accepting cryptocurrencies this year after receiving about 20 inquires, said gallery manager Vince Notardonato.	 Bulatova, who has four galleries in the western United States, made her first sale with bitcoin at her Palm Springs location in mid-March. Bulatova, who was pursing a doctorate in economics before launching her art career, said she has a personal interest in cryptocurrencies.	 Her experience has shown her that acceptance in Las Vegas venues will be a function not only of customer demand but also of management understanding and enthusiasm. ”I thought accepting cryptocurrencies would increase the buying pool of people. If someone bought cryptocurrencies a few years ago, they can afford to buy a lot of things now, like artwork,” she said.

31,newsfeeds@nzherald.co.nz,"	 Bitcoin began the week on a down note, declining as much as 8.7 per cent, pushing the biggest cryptocurrency's decline for March to about 25 per cent.	 Bitcoin dropped below US$8,000 ($10,964) to US$7,863, according to Coindesk.	 Twitter Inc. confirmed Monday that it's banning advertisements for initial coin offerings and token sales on its social-media platform. The decision comes after Facebook Inc. banned cryptocurrency ads in January and Alphabet Inc.'s Google said it would ban such ads starting in June, as part of a broader effort to crack down on deceptive and misleading advertising on their platforms.	 After reaching a record high of almost US$20,000 in December, Bitcoin has slumped about 60 per cent as investors reconsider the prospects of the digital currency and regulators around the world increase scrutiny.	 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sent a number of subpoenas earlier this month to ICO teams it suspects are breaking securities regulations, and it has warned since July that some of the offerings may be breaking securities regulations. Twitter said on March 7 that it was implementing measures to prevent crypto scams.","Bitcoin began the week on a down note, declining as much as 8.7 per cent, pushing the biggest cryptocurrency's decline for March to about 25 per cent.Bitcoin dropped below US$8,000 ($10,964) to US$7,863, according to Coindesk.Twitter...",Nzherald.co.nz,http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12020925,2018-03-26 22:56:45+00:00,"Bitcoin breaches US$8,000 level as March slump accelerates"

33,Reuters Editorial,"2 Min Read	(Reuters) - Atlanta is still struggling with its ability to collect online payments of bills and fees, officials said on Monday, four days after a ransomware attack snarled the computer system of Georgia’s capital city. 	Hackers caused outages of services offered through the city’s website and broader computer system while demanding a ransom of $51,000 paid in bitcoin to unlock the system.  	“This is much bigger than a ransomware attack, this really is an attack on our government,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told a news conference. “We are dealing with a (cyber) hostage situation.” 	She did not say whether Atlanta would pay the ransom. Atlanta officials said they have determined the hackers’ identity but declined to elaborate. City representatives were not immediately available for further comment. 	Bottoms said only that the hackers entered the city’s digital system remotely as opposed having had internal access. 	Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computers or computer networks and then freezes them, with the attackers demanding a ransom in order to restore services. The initial assault often comes via a phishing link that someone within the network opens on their email.  	As the disruption in Atlanta persists, the city is losing out financially, Bottoms told an earlier news conference on Friday. It was unclear how much it stands to lose or when the city expects to get its computer system fully operational again.

37,Cointelegraph By Rakesh Upadhyay,"Cointelegraph	Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies.	Price Analysis	The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.	The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.	During a bear market, fear grips the investors, resulting in a long liquidation. While some believe that the bubble in Bitcoin has burst, others believe that the current fall is only a correction, which will lead to higher prices later in the year.	Founder and chairman of investment firm LDJ Capital, David Drake believes that Bitcoin will rally to $30,000 by the year-end. That is a whopping 262 percent return from the current levels.	Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, believes that Bitcoin can replace the fiat currencies within a decade.	A few positive voices in a sea of gloom is a welcome change. Let’s see if the short-term picture is improving or not.	Though Bitcoin broke out of the descending channel on March 20, it could not cross above the 20-day EMA. Currently, prices are again threatening to dip back into the channel, which is a bearish development. Our long positions initiated at $8,800 are trading under a loss. As the setup looks negative, we suggest booking a loss on 50 percent of the open positions and holding the rest with the stops at $7,600.		The next support on the downside is the March 18 lows of $7,715, below which, a retest of the February 06 lows of $6,075.04 is possible.	Our bearish view on the BTC/USD pair will be invalidated if prices breakout and sustain above the 50-day SMA.	Ethereum is in a strong downtrend. It continues to trade inside the channel and below both the moving averages, which are falling sharply. The recovery attempt by the bulls failed at the $590 levels.  		The final critical support on the downside is the March 18 lows of $452.32. Below this level, the ETH/USD pair can fall to $385.	The RSI is deeply oversold, which shows that the selling has been overdone. We anticipate another pullback attempt within the next few days. The first sign of strength will be when the bulls sustain above $600. Until then, the bears will continue to sell on rallies.	Bitcoin Cash has broken below the $1,000 levels after holding it for three days. The next support on the downside is the March 18 lows $884.7951.		If the BCH/USD pair breaks below this, it will retest the February 06 lows of $778.2021. Bears have the upper hand as they have not allowed the price to climb above the 20-day EMA since February 21.	We should turn positive only after the cryptocurrency breaks out of the 50-day SMA.       	Our anticipation of a range bound trading action on Ripple is proving to be wrong. Prices are falling sharply towards the lower end of the range at $0.56270. Our suggested long position at $0.71, on March 19 is deeply in the red. Our stop loss is at $0.52, just below the March 18 lows.		If the XRP/USD pair breaks below $0.5375, a fall to $0.22 is possible, because there is no support in between.	The cryptocurrency will become positive only above $0.72.	Stellar did not close above our buy trigger of $0.25, as recommended in the previous analysis. Therefore, we don’t have any position in it.		The XLM/USD pair is gradually falling towards the $0.2 levels, which is a critical support. If this support breaks, the cryptocurrency can slide to the support line of the descending channel at $0.1 levels.	We’d better wait for prices to turn up before suggesting any long positions in it.	Our long position in Litecoin recommended at $165 is under loss. Traders who have initiated long positions should keep the stop loss at $142.		The LTC/USD pair has again fallen below the downtrend line, which is a bearish sign. A critical support is the March 18 lows of $144.544. If this level breaks, the support line of the symmetrical triangle can provide support at $127, below which a retest of the February 02 lows of $107.102 will be on the cards.	The virtual currency will turn bullish only after it breaks out of the $200 levels.	Though Cardano broke out of the downtrend line on March 21, it could not break out of the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance at 0.00002460. Our buy levels of 0.000025 have not triggered and stand canceled.		The ADA/BTC pair will spend a few days in the range of 0.00001690 and 0.00002460. A breakdown below the supports will prove to be bearish while a breakout will carry prices higher. Therefore, we need to wait for a breakout and close above the overhead resistance before initiating any trade.	NEO has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $65.		After the initial bounce from the lows of $49.04 on March 18, we had expected the bulls to strongly defend the $65 levels during the pullback. However, after failing to rise above $70 for the past three days, prices have now broken down of the support levels.	Next, if $49.04 level breaks, the NEO/USD pair can slide to $31.15 levels. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls quickly reverse and sustain prices above $65.   	We wanted to buy EOS once it broke out of the descending channel but that did not happen. After staying above the 20-day EMA for the past five days, prices have slipped this week.		The EOS/USD pair has some support at the $5.84 mark. Below that, it can slide to $5 levels.	On the upside, even if the bulls manage to push prices above the 20-day EMA, they will again face a stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA.	The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

		NEW YORK (AP) - Twitter says it will ban or restrict advertisements related to cryptocurrencies in an attempt to crack down on fraud. The move follows similar steps by Facebook and Google earlier this year.	Twitter said the new rules will roll out starting Tuesday and will apply to all advertisers in about a month. The new policy prohibits ads for initial coin offerings, in which a startup issues a currency that can be used to buy services with the company.	Ads for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services, meanwhile, will be restricted and limited to those that are provided by a public company under Twitter's new policy.	The price of a bitcoin dropped below $8,000 on Monday.	Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
